# Fraud Detection Dashboard

This project offers the objectives and contributions as follows:

   1. Build machine learning model to classify and predict the status of credit card transaction, whether fraud or not. 
   2. Deploy the model performance to new datasets in web applications.

Here is the workflow of the project:
  
  1. Import dataset -> get data from https://github.com/namebrandon/Sparkov_Data_Generation. Read data train and data test.
  2. Data Preparation -> data cleaning and data wrangling for getting ready for machine learning model
  3. Modelling -> apply a few machine learning model and compare the performance
  4. Improve model -> get best parameter for the best algorithm
  5. Save the best model and apply to the app.py -> design the dashboard display and show prediction results. Providing the probability of the transaction to being fraud.
  6. Deploy the app.py using Heroku.
